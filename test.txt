- DONE You are adding only the body of the post through the add post “page”, but a post has a 
date too(Figure 2). 
- DONE The a post “page” should fetch and present a specific post (the one clicked on in the 
homepage) from the database, and it should contain two buttons: 
a. DONE update, when pressed on, will update the post in the database; and 
b. DONE deletes, when pressed on, will delete the post from the database.
- DONE If a user is not logged in, she should not be allowed to reach/access “a post” or “add 
post” “pages”.
